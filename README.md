## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Data Collection**  
   Government datasets containing state, city, year, month, and price data are loaded and processed.

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Cleaning and structuring the data using **Pandas** and **One Hot Encoding**.
   - Handling missing values and preparing it for training.

3. **Model Training**  
   - A **Linear Regression** model is trained on the processed data.
   - The model learns to predict prices based on the input features: state, city, year, and month.

4. **Prediction**  
   - The trained model predicts the price of a commodity based on user-defined parameters.
